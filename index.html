                <p>
                    Although people have been discovering fossils for most of human history, 
                    our knowledge of life on earth grew by leaps and bounds in the 19th century. 
                    That century saw many key fossil discoveries, from the aquatic monsters 
                    found by Mary Anning to the many species excavated in the “Bone Wars” of the 
                    American West. The term “dinosaur” first appeared in the 19th century, as did 
                    the term “paleontology” itself. Fossil discoveries coincided with Charles 
                    Darwin's emerging theory of evolution, which provided a useful framework for 
                    understanding extinct creatures -- and also had weighty implications for 
                    humanity's place in the natural order.

                    paleontology as a way to discuss important concepts.
