                        One of the major figures in 19th century paleontology was Mary Anning. 
                        Anning made many spectacular fossil discoveries in the seaside cliffs 
                        of Lyme Regis, England. Some of her notable finds were bones of prehistoric 
                        aquatic reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and the long-necked 
                        plesiosaurs. Anning also collected fossils of marine invertebrates, notably 
                        recovering usable ink from the remains of prehistoric squid-like creatures. 
                        Her discoveries caused a sensation, but as a working-class woman in the 19th
                        century, she did not always receive proper credit for her work.

                        <p>
                            Many books claim that Anning was the inspiration for the phrase "She 
                            sells seashells by the seashore." However, experts have found no 
                            clear evidence to support this claim.

                                the kinds of prehistoric beasts discovered by Mary Anning. This was 
                                one of the first illustrations of prehistoric creatures as they 
                                would have appeared in life, and prints of the artwork were popular 
                                in the 1830s.
