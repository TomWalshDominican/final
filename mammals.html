                    <p>
                        The 19th century was an important era for research into prehistoric 
                        mammals. In South America, Charles Darwin himself collected several 
                        significant mammal fossils, such as giant sloth bones. Many unusual 
                        mammal remains were also discovered during the so-called “Bone Wars,” 
                        a fierce race between academic rivals to excavate fossils in the 
                        American West.
